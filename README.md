Particle Physics Classifier: Gamma vs. Hadron
This Django-based web application provides a platform for the identification and analysis of atmospheric Cherenkov gamma-ray showers versus hadronic background noise. Using data-driven insights, the project aims to streamline the classification process essential for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy.

🌌 Project Overview
The detection of high-energy gamma rays is often hindered by the massive background of cosmic-ray hadrons. This project leverages Django to provide a user-friendly interface for:

Data Visualization: Interactive plots of particle attributes (Length, Width, Size, Conc, etc.).

Model Prediction: A backend integration of machine learning models to classify input parameters.

Dataset Management: Easy uploading and cleaning of particle physics datasets.
