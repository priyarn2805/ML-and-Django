    "### **Project:** SVM Particle Classification & Data Auditing\n",

    "## **Slide 1: System Overview (MVT Architecture)**\n",
    "**How Django bridges the gap between AI and User.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Django follows the **Model-View-Template** architecture. In the BugsOut terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model (The Archive):** A database blueprint that stores 10 scientific features and the final AI prediction.\n",
    "* **View (The Logic):** The \"Brain\" that cleans the raw input, runs the SVM algorithm, and decides if a particle is Gamma or Hadron.\n",
    "* **Template (The Interface):** The Gold & Black high-visibility terminal that users use to interact with the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Slide 2: The Database (models.py)**\n",
    "**Storing scientific telemetry data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each particle entry consists of:\n",
    "* **Scientific Measurements:** `fLength`, `fWidth`, `fSize`, etc., stored as `FloatField` for high precision.\n",
    "* **Classification:** `prediction_label` stored as a `CharField` (Gamma or Hadron).\n",
    "* **Traceability:** `created_at` records the exact second of the scan for the \"Audit Log.\"\n",

    "## **Slide 3: Machine Learning View (views.py)**\n",
    "**Integrating the Support Vector Machine (SVM).**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user clicks **\"INITIATE CLASSIFICATION\"**, the view performs these steps:\n",
    "1.  **POST Check:** Verifies the user submitted a valid form.\n",
    "2.  **String Parsing:** Splitting the \"bulk array\" text into 10 separate numeric values.\n",
    "3.  **SVM Hyperplane:** The model analyzes where the data sits relative to the decision boundary.\n",
    "4.  **Database Commit:** Saving the result so it persists in the Audit History.\n",

    "## **Slide 4: Advanced Features (URLs & Reporting)**\n",
    "**Building professional-grade tools.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Secure Routing:** Named URLs (e.g., `export_csv`) allow us to link buttons to Python logic without hardcoding addresses.\n",
    "* **CSRF Security:** A digital handshake (`{% csrf_token %}`) that ensures only the authorized BugsOut terminal can talk to the server.\n",
    "* **Data Portability:** An export function that streams database rows directly into a downloadable CSV file.\n",

    "* **Gold & Glow Theme:** Uses CSS variables (`--gold-primary`) and radial gradients for a modern laboratory look.\n",
    "* **Dynamic Links:** Conditional logic displays different Wikipedia technical specs based on whether Gamma or Hadron was detected.\n",
    "* **Official Audit Report:** A specialized `@media print` CSS block that converts the dark web app into a clean, white-paper report for printing.\n",
